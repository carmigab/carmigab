# Who am I
👋 Hello, fellow coders! I'm Gabriele, a passionate master's student in Computer Science and Engineering at Politecnico di Milano, specializing in Artificial Intelligence. I worked part-time as a software engineer at Blue Reply for over a year while studying, I've been a two times Software Development Engineer Intern at AWS during summer 2024 and autumn 2025 and also a Software Engineer Intern in Google in summer 2025.

🚀 I love to solve problems through software. I'm specialing in the field of AI because I found it really fascinating but I enjoy almost any field of Computer Science. Give me a problem and an IDE and I'm happy to dive deep on it.

🌟 When I'm not immersed in lines of code, you can find me enjoying one of my various hobbies.
* 🥋 As a karate blackbelt and teacher, I am deeply passionate about martial arts. The discipline and focus I've gained from martial arts seamlessly integrate into my approach to problem-solving in the tech world.
* 🎸🎷 Beyond the screen, I have a love for music. Whether it's strumming on my guitar or belting out tunes on the saxophone, I find creative inspiration in the harmonies and rhythms of music.
