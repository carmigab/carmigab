# Who am I
üëã Hello, fellow coders! I'm Gabriele, a passionate master's student in Computer Science and Engineering at Politecnico di Milano, specializing in Artificial Intelligence. I worked part-time as a software engineer at Blue Reply for over a year while studying and I've been a Software Development Engineer Intern at AWS for 3 months during summer 2024.

üöÄ My journey involves a deep dive into the realms of AI, with a focus on crafting intelligent and innovative solutions. I find joy in coding and software development, always on the lookout for exciting projects to challenge my skills. Learning new technologies is my forte, and I thrive on putting my newfound knowledge into practice.

üíª When I'm not immersed in lines of code, you can find me exploring the latest developments in the tech world, brainstorming new project ideas, or simply enjoying the process of continuous learning. Let's connect, collaborate, and create amazing things together! üåê‚ú®

üåü Interests and Hobbies:
* ü•ã As a karate blackbelt and teacher, I am deeply passionate about martial arts. The discipline and focus I've gained from martial arts seamlessly integrate into my approach to problem-solving in the tech world.
* üé∏üé∑ Beyond the screen, I have a love for music. Whether it's strumming on my guitar or belting out tunes on the saxophone, I find creative inspiration in the harmonies and rhythms of music.
